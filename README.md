# Vision Browser
A minimal web browser. Created using Electron.

**In its current state, Vision is very basic and full of bugs & glitches. I *DON'T* suggest using this browser for any serious use.** That being said, if you *do* decide to use it, Vision is currently much more suitable as a single-purpose utility as it does not currently support multiple tabs (and will probably not until a viable solution is found, without being too inefficient). An example of using Vision as a single-purpose utility would be for something like digital signage.

## Version numbers
Each release of Vision uses *two* version identifiers/numbers.

**DATE-TIME VERSION ID/NUMBER**
Example: 20.02.01
Format: yy.mm.vr
*yy represents the two-digit, mm represents the two-digit month, and vr represents the version revision (more digits can be added for this one!)*

**SEMANTIC VERSIONING**
Example: 1.0.0
*Learn more about semantic versioning [here](https://semver.org/).*
