# Vision Browser
A minimal web browser. Created using Electron.

**In its current state, Vision is very basic and full of bugs & glitches. I *DON'T* suggest using this browser for any serious use.** That being said, if you *do* decide to use it, Vision is currently much more suitable as a single-purpose utility as it does not currently support multiple tabs (and will probably not until a viable solution is found, without being too inefficient). An example of using Vision as a single-purpose utility would be for something like digital signage.
